function grid = RegularizeForcGrid(M, Ha, Hb)
% Takes measurements M measured on an irrgular grid Ha, Hb and interpolates
% it onto a regular grid. This is necessary as the VSM does not usually
% take the measurements at the exact field points, so some slight variation
% is expected.
%
% M - raw measurements (matrix) taken on an irregular grid Ha, Hb
% Ha, Hb - the irregular grid the measurements are taken on (matrices). 
%
% Alternatively, only a princtonforc structure can be passed as the single
% argument. 
%
% OUTPUT: 
% grid - a structure containing the regularized grid & measurements:
%   grid.M - measurements (matrix) on a regular grid.
%   grid.Ha, grid.Hb - the regular grid (matrices).
