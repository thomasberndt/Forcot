# Waiting for Forcot: Accelerating FORC Processing 10x using a Fast-Fourier-Transform Algorithm

Forcot is a new First-Order Reversal-Curve (FORC) processing software that uses a Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithm to accelerate smoothing significantly. Its aim is to provide as easy and frictionless a user-experience as possible to create print-quality FORC diagrams with minimum effort. 

When using the software to produce figures, or when using any of the code, theory, figures, data, please cite the corresponding paper
