## Waiting for Forcot: Accelerating FORC Processing 100x using a Fast-Fourier-Transform Algorithm

Forcot is a new First-Order Reversal-Curve (FORC) processing software that uses a Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithm to accelerate smoothing significantly. Its aim is to provide as easy and frictionless a user-experience as possible to create print-quality FORC diagrams with minimum effort. 

When using the software to produce figures, or when using any of the code, theory, figures, data, please cite the corresponding paper 
Berndt, T. A. & Chang, L. (2019). Waiting for Forcot: Accelerating FORC Processing 100x using a Fast-Fourier-Transform Algorithm. Submitted to: Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems.
