## Waiting for Forcot: Accelerating FORC Processing 100x using a Fast-Fourier-Transform Algorithm

Forcot is a new First-Order Reversal-Curve (FORC) processing software that uses a Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithm to accelerate smoothing significantly. Its aim is to provide as easy and frictionless a user-experience as possible to create print-quality FORC diagrams with minimum effort. 

When using the software to produce figures, or when using any of the code, theory, figures, data, please cite the corresponding paper 
Berndt, T. A. & Chang, L. (2019). Waiting for Forcot: Accelerating FORC Processing 100x using a Fast-Fourier-Transform Algorithm. Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems.


* [Download windows installer v1.0.1](Forcot_WebInstaller_v1.0.0.exe)
* [Download mac installer v1.0.1](Forcot_MacInstaller_v1.0.1.zip)

For the Mac version, you may have to use the command  `sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine Forcot_MacInstaller_v1.0.1.app` to allow installing the app. Alternatively, you can download the [Matlab version](https://github.com/thomasberndt/Forcot/releases/latest) (this requires the curve fitting toolbox, the image toolbox, and the statistics toolbox).
